# Project-App
This project is used to see a list of vehicles and the associated information and with that information make it possible to see them depending on range of price and removing values with no information on the odometer. As well as visualizing the difference in cost depending on the fuel type, trasmission type, odometer reading, and how many cylinders the vehicle has. 
This was made possible with the libraries included in the app file and especially with the methods introduced by streamlit.
